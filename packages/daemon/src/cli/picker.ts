/**
 * Choosing which agents to use, with arrow keys.
 *
 * `pew2 setup` finds every agent on PATH and offers all of them. That is the
 * right default but the wrong ending: an installed agent nobody uses still gets
 * spawned every time the phone connects, still holds memory, and still fills a
 * row in the drawer. Turning one off was possible only by remembering a command
 * and its id, which is not a thing anyone does.
 *
 * So setup asks. Arrows to move, space to toggle, enter to accept.
 *
 * Split into a reducer and a renderer with no I/O in either, because terminal
 * interaction is otherwise untestable: raw mode needs a real TTY, and a test
 * that drives one is testing the terminal rather than the behaviour. Here the
 * key handling and the drawing are both ordinary functions, and the imperative
 * shell around them is small enough to read in one go.
